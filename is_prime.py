# 2) Print a message showing the range: from `lower` to `upper`.
# 3) Use a loop to check every number `num` from `lower` to `upper` (inclusive).
# 4) For each `num`, first check if it is greater than 1.
# (Because prime numbers are always greater than 1.)
# 5) If `num` is greater than 1, test if it is prime:
# a) Try dividing `num` by every number `i` from 2 to `num - 1`.
# b) If `num` is divisible by any `i` (remainder is 0), it is NOT prime → stop checking (break).
# 6) If the loop finishes without finding any divisor (no break happened),
# then `num` is prime → print `num`.
